We are excited to share the latest research led by Korthauer lab members!

* Erick's preprint exploring how much genetics and the environment contribute to shaping the early life DNA methylome: ["RAMEN: Dissecting individual, additive and interactive gene-environment contributions to DNA methylome variability in cord blood"](https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.05.08.652964) - in collaboration with the [Kobor lab](https://www.bcchr.ca/kobor-lab).

* Ning's preprint introducing a tool for cell type deconvolution of methylated sequencing reads: ["decemedip: hierarchical Bayesian modeling for cell type deconvolution of immunoprecipitation-based DNA methylomes"](https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.05.09.653152) - in collaboration with the [Baca lab](https://bacalab.dana-farber.org/).

[Erick](https://erick-navarrodelgado.netlify.app) (he/him) is a PhD student in [Bioinformatics](https://www.bioinformatics.ubc.ca) at UBC, co-supervised by [Dr. Michael Kobor](https://bcchr.ca/kobor-lab) and Dr. Keegan Korthauer. He holds a B.Sc. degree in Biology from the [National Autonomous University of Mexico](https://www.unam.mx) (UNAM). At the Kobor & Korthauer lab, his research goal is to develop robust bioinformatical methods to integrate genome, exposome and DNA methylome data to model the factors that contribute to DNA methylation variability across early life. Using a blend of statistical approaches such as machine learning, variance decomposition and longitudinal data analysis, he aims to improve our understanding of how and under which conditions individual genetic susceptibility and environmental exposures may work together to influence DNA methylation in a highly sensitive human developmental period.

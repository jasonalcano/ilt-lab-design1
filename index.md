The Korthauer lab is a group of researchers working to advance statistical methodology and computational tools for the analysis of high-dimensional genomics and epigenomics data. With these tools, we aim to uncover new molecular signals in cancer, child health, and development. Our group is based at the [University of British Columbia](https://ubc.ca) and [BC Children's Hospital Research Institute](https://bcchr.ca).

We develop and apply tailored statistical tools designed to extract biological insights from vast amounts of genomic and epigenomic data. New technologies are constantly being developed to increase the scope and scale of genomic studies, which introduces new data science challenges for us to tackle.

Our interdisciplinary research lies at the interface of statistics and genomics. With our methods development work, we aim to advance statistical methodology and computational tools for the analysis of high-dimensional biological data. Our work is also highly collaborative; we routinely work alongside experimentalists and clinicians to apply cutting edge bioinformatics tools to uncover new molecular signals in cancer, child health, and development. We are especially interested in advancing understanding of epigenetics - the study of how gene activity is controlled through mechanisms that don't involve changes in the DNA sequence itself - at the genome scale. You can check out our publications listed below, or find them listed on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=spd-KjUAAAAJ&hl=en).
